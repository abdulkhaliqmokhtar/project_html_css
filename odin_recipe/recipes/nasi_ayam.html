    <p>
      My favorite food of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients.
      The secret is in the broth: this is the most amazing, flavorsome chicken
      rice dish you've ever tried. Garnish with sliced cucumber, spring onions,
      and cilantro.

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Trim chicken of all excess fat, reserving fat.</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken, spring onion, 3 cloves crushed garlic, and one thumb
        ginger in a large pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil;
        reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming any scum off the surface, until
        an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
        thigh, near the bone, reads 74 degrees Celsius, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the pot, reserving broth. Rub chicken with salt.
        Chop into pieces and arrange on a serving plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt reserved chicken fat in a large pot over medium heat. Add rice, 3
        cloves minced garlic, crushed 1 thumb ginger, and salt; cook and stir
        until rice is glossy and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour enough reserved chicken broth into the pot to cover rice by half an
        inch. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is
        absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff
        with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine red chile peppers, juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved
        chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1/2-inch piece ginger, 1/4 teaspoon
        salt, and 1 pinch sugar in a blender; blend until garlic chile dip is
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves
        garlic, one thumb piece ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender;
        blend until ginger dip is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Serve garlic chile and ginger dips alongside chicken and rice.</li>
    </ol>
